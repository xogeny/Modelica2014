These tools have been developed to address the gaps and limitations encountered in legacy simulation tools. These tools were originally designed for the analysis of individual domains of buildings, and have been difficult to integrate with other tools for runtime data exchange. The coupling has been realized by use of the Functional Mock-up Interface for co-simulation, which standardizes an application programming interface for simulator interoperability that has been adopted in a variety of industrial domains.\nAs a variety of coupling scenarios are possible, this paper provides users with guidance on what coupling may be best suited for their application. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how tools can be integrated into a building management system to support the operation of buildings. These tools may be a design model that is used for real-time performance monitoring, a fault detection and diagnostics algorithm, or a control sequence, each of which may be exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit and made available in a building control systems as an input/output block. We anticipate that this capability can contribute to bridging the observed performance gap between design and operational energy use of buildings.\n", "authors": ["Thierry Stephane Nouidui", "Michael Wetter"], "title": "Tool coupling for the design and operation of building energy and control systems based on the Functional Mock-up Interface standard"}, "85": {"abstract": "An industrial system is generally designed according to several points of view and analyses (performance, integration, safety, maintenance \u2026).\nThe common point between these analyses is the system architecture, which is often described as a hierarchical structure of components. Therefore, to enable analysis, we must associate to the ar-chitecture models that depend on the type of the analysis to perform. These models may be very different (type or level of details). For example, physical behaviors are often modeled by sets of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) or Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE) with variables related to a continuous time, whereas  safety tools generally use Boolean models with continuous or discrete time.\nSafety is a very important criterion for aircraft systems. It is also mandatory to be able to analyze the system as a whole in order to take into account the dependencies between all the subsystems. The model to be analyzed contains then a great number of components, in consequence, the number of elementary failures is high (104). Fault Tree analysis with a BDD (Binary Decision Diagram) engine to compute probabilities and minimum cutsets is an efficient technique to analyze such models. However this technique makes the assumption of independence between elementary failures, which is not always the case in redundant complex systems func-tioning in large range of environmental conditions (temperature, electromagnetic radiations \u2026) as for aircraft systems.\nThis paper describes a Modelica library which provides fault trees of the whole system with possible dependencies between elementary failures. But this is only for system analysis which does not take into account repairs. This hypothesis is true when analyzing a single flight. A coupling with a BDD engine allows the analysis of the generated failure tree (probability calculus, minimal cuts\u2026), which can then be represented in the system architecture diagram.\n", "authors": ["Claire Campan", "Eric Thomas"], "title": "Safety analysis of aircraft systems using Modelica"}, "3": {"abstract": "Abstract Electric machine theory and electric machine simulations models are often limited to three phases.

An ERS has twofold advantages: on the one side it reduces the apparent power peaks from the mains power system. On the other side the overall energy consumption can also be reduced therewith.

Test cases with difference in solar insolation for different part of the year is set up and simulated. These tests shows that the system model works as expected but lacks some of the dynamics present in a real thermal power plant. This is due to the use of a simplified Rankine cycle. The collector and solar model is also verified against different papers regarding solar collector performance and shows good results, which indicates a correct implementation of the different loss models.", "authors": ["Robert \u00d6sterholm", "Jens P\u00e5lsson"], "title": "Dynamic modelling of a parabolic trough solar power plant"}, "73": {"abstract": "Simulation models play a fundamental role in the development of transmission control software. In the ideal case, the same model can be used throughout the whole development process from concept and design over implementation to system verification. The idea is to use one uniform model along this V-scheme. This leads to the requirement that simulations have to be able to run in real-time on hardware-in-the-loop platforms. On the other hand, very detailed models of some components might be needed during the early design phase.\nThus, a trade-off between modeling depth and computational performance has to be found. This may be achieved by selectively simplifying parts of the model that are prone to generating stiff sub-systems or a large number of state events.\nWithin this framework, the present paper introduces the Modelica simulation model of TraXon, the new modular transmission for heavy commercial vehicles by ZF. The model can be adapted to various needs by replacing components according to the required modeling depth and/or dynamical behavior. \nAfter a brief overview of the ZF in-house Modelica libraries and the architecture of the TraXon model, some approaches and tools are described for evaluating and optimizing models with respect to real-time issues.", "authors": ["Jochen K\u00f6hler", "Michael Kuebler", "Julian King"], "title": "Transmission Modeling in Modelica: A consistent approach for several software development platforms"}, "72": {"abstract": "Differential-algebraic equations naturally arise in the modeling of dynamical processes,\nin particular using Modelica as modeling language.\nIn general, the model equations can be of higher index, i.e., they can contain  hidden \nconstraints which lead to instabilities and order reductions in the \nnumerical integration.\nTherefore, a regularization or remodeling of the model equations is required.\nOne way to obtain the required information on the hidden constraints is a structural analysis based on the sparsity pattern of the system.\nFor the determination of a regular index-reduced system formulation then, usually, a crucial step is the so-called state selection.\nIn this paper, we will present a new approach for the remodeling of dynamical systems that uses the information obtained from the structural analysis to construct a regularized overdetermined system formulation.\nThis overdetermined system can then be solved using specially adapted numerical integrators, in such a way that the state selection can be performed within the numerical integrator during runtime of the simulation.", "authors": ["Lena Scholz", "Andreas Steinbrecher"], "title": "Efficient Numerical Integration of Dynamical Systems based on Structural-Algebraic Regularization avoiding State Selection"}, "71": {"abstract": "Parallel simulation is currently considered to be one of the most promising ways to reduce calculation time when simulating large and complex models. During the last years, various approaches have been developed to obtain independent subsystems from the DAE-system which can be solved in parallel. In most cases, these subsystems have a strongly varying size which makes it difficult to distribute the workload evenly across all CPU cores. Thus, there is a need for partitioning large equation systems into smaller subsystems which can be solved in turn on various cores. This work represents a contribution to handle large equation systems in order to solve them in parallel. There is both a numerical and a symbolic approach introduced which can be used to partition single, large threads consisting of one system of equations into multiple smaller threads.", "authors": ["Volker Waurich", "Ines Gubsch", "Jens Bastian", "Jens Frenkel"], "title": "Approaches to the parallel computation of linear and non-linear systems of equations in Modelica based models"}, "70": {"abstract": "Specialized simulation tools exist for technical systems from different research areas. When doing interdisciplinary research such tools need to be coupled. We implemented an interface such that simulation results and inputs can be exchanged at run time between a Modelica simulation tool and an external tool using a network socket and the TCP and IP protocols. We show the functionality of the communication interface models in two applications. Firstly we present an implementation for data exchange in a hardware-in-the-loop system. The results show that the interface is suitable for the intended purpose. Secondly we check the speed of the communication interface with a simulation of a simple feedback control. We obtain results that indicate that the interface can operate in time regimes of microseconds.", "authors": ["Georg Ferdinand Schneider", "Jens Oppermann", "Ana Constantin", "Rita Streblow", "Dirk M\u00fcller"], "title": "A TCP/IP-based Communication Interface Library for Co-Simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop"}, "79": {"abstract": "Concepts such as smart grids, distributed generation and micro--generation of energy, market--driven as well as demand--side energy management, are becoming increasingly important and relevant as emerging trends in the design, management and control of energy systems.\nAppropriate modeling and design, efficient management and control strategies of such systems are currently being studied.In this line of research a very important enabling component is efficient and reliable simulation. However those energy models are typically large, stiff and exhibiting heavy discontinuities, and at the same time consist of interconnected multi--domain subsystems encompassing electrical, thermal, and thermo-fluid models.\nObject-Oriented (O--O) languages such as Modelica are obviously well-suited for the modelling of such systems; however, traditional state-of-the-art hybrid differential algebraic equation solvers cannot efficiently simulate these systems especially when their size grows to the order of hundreds, thousands, or even more interconnected units.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to show, through a couple of exemplary case studies, that Quantized State System (QSS) integration methods are ideally suited to solve models of such systems, as they scale up better than traditional methods with the system size, and provide time savings of several orders of magnitude, while achieving comparable numerical precision.", "authors": ["Xenofon Floros", "Federico Bergero", "Nicola Ceriani", "Francesco Casella", "Ernesto Kofman", "Francois E.
