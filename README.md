Modelica2014
============

An application to help people schedule participation in Modelica 2014.

This application is now obsolete since the Modelica 2014 conference is
behind us.  But in case someone (for some strange reason) wanted to see
how I created the app, I thought I'd just make it public.

I suspect by the time the next Modelica event happens, the landscape of
client-side technologies will have shifted so much that what is here
will seem quaint by comparison. :-)
